    <h1 id="top">SCRUM</h1>
    <h2 id="whatis">What is Scrum?</h2>
    <p>Scrum is an agile form of software development that involves spreading out each part of the software into small
        and quick tasks and then performing them in "sprints"</p>
    <p>The main appeal to Scrum is how it enables the development cycles and teams to work closely together and be fully
        aware of everything that's being worked on, which further promotes close and tight-knit teamwork.</p>
    <img src="resources/img/agile.jpeg" alt="agile development image" class="center-img">
    <h2 id="agile">What is Agile Development?</h2>
    <p>Agile development is the term used to differentiate it from the classic "waterfall" development which is a
        top-down development cycle that is known for causing delays due to how the project goes through its stages. It's
        been proven to be slower and lacking in versatility.</p>
    <p>Agile Development is at it's core for quick processes individualized and compartmentalized for a faster and
        quicker development cycle, they are known for being fluid and open for daily iterations and updates to the
        project being worked on.</p>

    <h2 id="benefits">What are the benefits to using Scrum?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Overview!</li>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_descr">Scrum has meetings regularly where team members provide info on their process. As well
                as before every sprint.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Commitment</li>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_descr">Due to everyone everyone being informed everyone is able to commit to each other and
                themselves the project with a clearer vision.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fast paced</li>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_descr">splitting all tasks into smaller compartments of work makes it so potentially the best
                one to do it, is able to do it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Light and small</li>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_descr">Scrum is made for smaller teams working closely, while it does scale, the core of it
                remains designed for smaller teams.
            </li>

    <h2 id="howit">How does Scrum work exactly?</h2>
    <img src="resources/img/scrum-agile-cycle.jpg" alt="Scrum Agile Cycle" class="center-img" id="cycle">
    <h3 class="no-mar-pad-low">Scrum functions on 3 key pillars:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="no-mar-pad">transparency</li>
        <li>inspection</li>
        <li>adaptation</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Transparency</h3>
    <p>Significant facets of the development must be visible to those responsible for the outcome. This is maintained
        through the almost daily "stand-ups" i.e meetings where everyone updates everyone else on how they're
        progressing with their work during the sprint.</p>
    <h3>Inspection</h3>
    <p>While using Scrum, it's always important to asses and analyze the Scrum artifacts, this being the backlogs,
        progress updates and more. Essentially the key thing here is that everyone (especially the responsible parties)
        are able to to inspect and look through the artifacts in order to facilitate their updates, fixes, etc.</p>
    <h3>Adaption</h3>
    <p>Through inspection, if an aspect of a process is deemed to deviate too much from the desired product, or is at
        risk of creating something unacceptable for the core product, it can then be adjusted, or removed. Everyonee
        that's a member of the scrum team must be aware and be prepared for this to happen with what they're working on.
        This insures that the final product maintains the goal that was set at the start.</p>
    <img src="resources/img/the-scrum-values-color.png" alt="Scrum values colors" class="right-img">
    <h2 id="values">Values of Scrum</h2>
    <p>Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, Courage. Are elements of Scrum that goes hand in hand when trying to work towards a common goal. This can all be applied to almost any types of group project. And to do so would be very useful!</p>
    <p>However, it's only when all the values are understood and lived by the team that the 3 pillars are able to fully realize its potential.</p>
    <p>Everyone on the team has to agree to be open and honest of the challenges they face and how their work is progressing, while also trusting and respecting all other members to be capable and independent people.</p>
