    <p>Scrum is an agile form of software development that involves spreading out each part of the software into small and quick tasks and then performing them in "sprints"</p>
    <p>The main appeal to Scrum is how it enables the development cycles and teams to work closely together and be fully aware of everything that's being worked on, which further promotes close and tight-knit teamwork.</p>
    <h2 id="agile">What is Agile Development?</h2>
    <p>Agile development is the term used to differentiate it from the classic "waterfall" development which is a top-down development cycle that is known for causing delays due to how the project goes through its stages. It's been proven to be slower and lacking in versatility.</p>
    <p>Agile Development is at it's core for quick processes individualized and compartmentalized for a faster and quicker development cycle, they are known for being fluid and open for daily iterations and updates to the project being worked on.</p>
